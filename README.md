# MJA DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

This is a work in progress library that I'm progressively building up as and when I need certain data structures and algorithms in my personal projects.

I'm mainly creating this library as a personal exercise to revise/improve my DSA knowledge.
But also because it gives me greater control and understanding over the implemented DSA than if I were to use another existing DSA library.

## License

I'm licensing my work under an MIT license,
I doubt anyone will want to use my DSA library as there are more complete ones out there (like the C++ algorithms library),
but I've licensed it under MIT so you're more than welcome to as long as you follow the licenses terms!
